This project is part of the iCodeThis challenge and showcases a minimalist approach to web development using pure HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript.
The implementation focuses on simplicity and functionality:

HTML and CSS: The structure and styling are crafted to ensure clarity and responsiveness without relying on external frameworks.
JavaScript: Enhances interactivity with features like a hamburger menu and an FAQ accordion.
The design prioritizes user experience and accessibility, making it a great example of clean and efficient front-end development.
